A computer vision project (Car brand classifier &amp; License plate text recogniser)


Report Utilities:

1) Introduction: Provide a concise explanation of the topic that you have chosen, and what has been done already on such topic (maybe by putting some references).
2) Method: Here you will explain what you have done. I do not need the code since you will provide it together with the report. You just need to explain the several steps/the model that you have implemented, together with the used dataset.
3) Results: Here you will show the results that you got, and the problems you encountered.

In each of the 3 parts, you can use equation, images, whatever you like, to explain what you have done.

Finally, the report should be at least 4 pages long, and no more 10 pages long.


Presentation Utilities:

- The entire presentation, independently of the number of group members, should not last more than 7 minutes;
- You can use any type of media you prefer, e.g. images/videos/etc., to make the presentation more catchy;
- You have to use your own device (laptop, tablet, whatsoever) for presenting;
- I know that some of you may not be so confident in talking in English. Although the latter is the language for the course, it is mainly for the language that must be used by the teacher during lecture. Despite I suggest to present in English, you can do the presentation in Italian. If you choose to do so, remember to make all the slides/material in English, so that every student will understand the work you have done.
